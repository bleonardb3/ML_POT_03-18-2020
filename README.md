Work with IBM's Watson Studio in this workshop to build, train, and test machine learning/deep learning models. Participants will be led through the following 3 hands-on labs. Note, the first lab is a prerequisite for the other labs. Once Lab-1 is completed, the other labs can be done in any order.  

1. [Lab-1](Lab-1) - This lab will set up the environment for the subsequent labs. 
1. [Lab-2](Lab-2) - This lab will feature the Watson Studio Data Refinery to demonstrate data profiling, visualization, and data preparation. 
1. [Lab-3](Lab-3) - This lab will feature the Watson Studio SPSS modeler to demonstrate visual drag and drop creation of a machine learning
